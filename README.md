## Game Preview
This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons.


## Getting started
Download or Clone the Repository.
Open index.html file to view the project in your browser.


## Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).


## How to Play
* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying icons.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same icons.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
